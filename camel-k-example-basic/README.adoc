# Camel K Basic Example

This example demonstrates how to get started with Camel K by showing you some of the most important
features that you should know before trying to develop more complex examples.

We are going to use Camel-Jbang to create the basic project for Camel Quarkus and then iterate to deploy on OCP.

## Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run CamelJBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== Export to Camel-Quarkus with on-premise as target

Let's use the export subcommand from camel-jbang

[source,sh]
----
$ camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.github.oscerd:camel-k-example-basic-migrated-to-quarkus:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=./camel-k-example-basic-quarkus-on-prem
----

This will create the directory in the same folder as the example

[source,sh]
----
Generating fresh run data
Exporting as Quarkus project to: ./camel-k-example-basic-quarkus-on-prem
----

Now we can try to run the project on-premise:

[source,sh]
----
[oscerd@ghost camel-k-example-basic]$ cd camel-k-example-basic-quarkus-on-prem/
[oscerd@ghost camel-k-example-basic-quarkus-on-prem]$ mvn quarkus:dev

=== Export to Camel-Quarkus with OCP as target

=== Prepare OCP cluster

You can create a Developer Sandbox on Openshift by looking at the following URL https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox

once you created everything you should be able to have access to your OCP Cluster. On the drop down menu on the right select copy login command.

Copy the login command and execute it

[source,sh]
----
$ oc login --token=<your_token> --server=<your_server_url>
----

You should already be on the namespace named `<username>-dev`.

=== Export to Camel-Quarkus with OCP as target

Let's use the export subcommand from camel-jbang

Since we are already authenticated from the step of Prepare OCP Cluster, we should be able to run the deploy directly:
